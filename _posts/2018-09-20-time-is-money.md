## Intro:
You don't realize how important time is until it hits you... And when it does, you quickly learn that planning and efficiency are your best friends.

## Motivation:
For my passion project at Metis I could choose to do any project that would require utilizing skills I have acquired in the last three months (Linear Regression, Classification, Clustering, NLP, Neural Networks, Time Series, etc.).
My professional expertise lies in transportation and so I decided on a topic as closely related to my domain as possible. Transportation industry as a whole, has always suffered from lack of transparency and therefore, inaccurate / inefficient pricing, as well as, disruptions due to traffic and weather.
The goal of my project is to predict Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) and Fare of a personalized individual taxi ride.

## Dataset:
I used a dataset of Chicago city taxi rides containing around 22 million records (2016 and 2017 Jan-Feb), as well as, Chicago O'Hare airport daily weather dataset.

More information about the **taxi ride** dataset can be found [here](https://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-data-released/).

The **Weather dataset** contains daily precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, maximum / minimum temperatures and flag for weather tags (such as thunder, heavy fog, tornado, etc.).  
More information about **weather** dataset can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/).

  Dear reader, if you're here I guess you'd like to find out more about me and this blog. 
So here it goes... I am a passionate business analyst who never stops learning, nor ever wants to stop. My journey to data science began in June of 2017 when my cousin sent me a link to MITx's online Python training course. I though "Why not? I already know MS SQL, this can't be that much harded" :smiley: Oh, dear, I didn't know just how wrong I was... But fast-forward 2 months and an average of 17 hours / week of studying on top of my full time job, I passed the final exam and received my first Python programming certificate. Fast-forward another six months and I was applying for a Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco. On the second attempt and months of re-learning Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probabilities and Statistics theory I got in!
 This blog started off as part of my education in the Immersive Data Science Bootcamp at Metis. Here you'll be able to read about my projects, investigations and technology related topics I feel most passionate about.
I honestly believe that technology isn't just for people who are good at it, technology is just like art and music, you don't need to know how to do it in order to understand and appreciate it.

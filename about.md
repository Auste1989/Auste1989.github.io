  Dear reader, if you're here I guess you'd like to find out more about me and this blog. 
So here it goes...  
</p>

I am a Business Analyst and I love my job! My favourite thing about my position is that I never stop learning.  
My journey to data science began in June of 2017, when my cousin Andrius sent me a link to MITx's online Python training course. I though "Why not? I already know Sequel, this can't be that hard..." :smiley:  
 Oh, I didn't know just how wrong I was... But fast-forward 2 months and 17 hours / week of learning (on top of my full time job), I passed the final exam and received my first Python programming certificate.  Fast-forward another six months I found myself applying for a full-time Data Science Bootcamp in San Francisco.  On the second attempt and months of re-learning Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probabilities and Statistics - **I got in!**  
 This blog started off as part of my education in the Immersive Data Science Bootcamp at Metis. Here you'll be able to read about my projects, investigations and technology related topics I feel most passionate about.
I honestly believe that technology isn't just for people who are good at it, technology is just like art and music, you don't have to know how to do it in order to appreciate it.

Thanks for reading!
